Anytime I have worked on software design, I approach it from a standpoint of making it the most organized and modular possible, as long as it is practical for the project. I take an iterative approach by building slowly and testing every change in case something goes wrong.
I believe making code readable helps me and anybody else who may be reviewing my code. It is very important to organize it well and use correct references throughout your code to make sure all pieces of the puzzle fit well together. 
For this assignment specifically, each milestone kinda forced a huge piece of the puzzle to come to fruition and be complete almost on its own. It changed the way I normally work on projects because I am usually not turning in each piece in between implementing different features.
I believe computational graphics is not my future and will not be something I am pursuing professionally but my experience in this course will be beneficial in the rest of my coursework while completing my degree program. 
The biggest skill that I learned in this course that will benefit me in the future is being more methodical in the way I am coding and taking each feature one piece at a time to implement the bigger picture.
